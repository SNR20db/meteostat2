meteostat2 is an alternative API for python. No manipulation of data occurs, simple and intuitive. Feast yourself on data already prepared to be consumed.

# Set up.
Using Pypi.

# Get data.


# Notes

You can parse a csv file format to json but no otherwise. If the inverse process was interesting, let me know.

Why did I build up so many methods instead of using a parameter? I tried to satisfy the user, taking for granted that he is not going to read the documentation and is not going likewise pay attention to the naming of methods. However I am willing to agglomarate those methods into just one parameter if I've got some feedback.
